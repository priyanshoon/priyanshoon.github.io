My name is Priyanshu Gupta, and I have deep interest on system programming and backend development.
I enjoy exploring things under the hood, diving into systems and problem-solving. Apart from that I play chess and do strength 
training.

Things that exites me the most, and can serve as conversation starters for you:
- Go Programming Language (I'm still learning tho).
- Ergonomic Keyboards.
- Backend Infrastructure & Distributed System.
- Fitness, Strength training.
- Compiler and Programming Languages.
