Yeah, excuse the drawing skillsâ€”I used to be decent at it, I swear. Anyway, letâ€™s not get distracted by my *propaganda artwork*.

# Keyboard Under 3K INR

Before this rabbit hole even started, I didnâ€™t think much about keyboards. For me, a keyboard was just a toolâ€”an input device to pass bytecode so my computer could do its magic and spit out human-readable code. Nothing more.

That was until I tried my friendâ€™s mechanical keyboard. Typing on it felt *elegant*â€”like my fingers were finally meant to be there. For the first time, I thought: *Maybe itâ€™s time I upgraded my keyboard.*

And so, the search began.

I set my budget at **3K INR**â€”not much by enthusiast standards, but it was my starting line. I wanted something customizable, but in this budget, thatâ€™s basically a unicorn. I almost settled for the **Cosmic Byte Phantom** or the **EvoFox Ronin**â€¦ but curiosity kept pushing me further.

One random YouTube scroll later, I stumbled upon something that completely changed the game. Honestly, I wish I had found it sooner.

# Layout Quest

Most people think **QWERTY** is *the* layout. Some might know about **Dvorak**. But thatâ€™s just scratching the surface. There are countless layouts, and even custom ones that you can design yourself.

At that time, I only knew about full-sized, TKL, 70%, and 60% keyboards. Then I discovered something wilderâ€”you can shrink it down even further. Sub-40%, sub-30%â€¦ layouts that look insane at first, but make perfect sense once you dive in.

Thatâ€™s when I found [Prajwal Nadigâ€™s blog](https://www.snprajwal.com/blog/ferricy-custom-split-keyboard/).

* That blog convinced me to build my own split keyboard.
* That blog also convinced me to double my budgetâ€”from 3K to **6K INR**.

# Preparation

I decided on the [Ferris Sweep Bling MX](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep)â€”wired version, because I like keeping things simple.

### Components I needed:

* 2Ã— Pro Micro-compatible microcontrollers
* 2Ã— Pin headers
* 34Ã— MX switches
* 34Ã— Kailh hotswap sockets
* 34Ã— Keycaps
* 2Ã— TRRS jacks
* 1Ã— TRRS cable
* 1Ã— USB-C cable

(Optional: reset switches for flashing, but you can just short the pins with a screwdriver if youâ€™re brave enough).

The switch and bottom plate files are in the repo. I skipped the bottom plate since I couldnâ€™t source M2 screws locally.

# My Layout

I mostly stuck to the original layout from the blog, with a few tweaks. Being a *brofessional full-time Vim userâ„¢*, I had to prioritize arrows. I mapped them on the right handâ€”so for example, holding **Backspace** and pressing **N** gives me the **Down Arrow**.

Iâ€™ll upload my full layout later, but honestlyâ€”you should research and design one that fits *your* workflow. Thatâ€™s half the fun.

Hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m at after just 20 days on this keyboard. ðŸš€
