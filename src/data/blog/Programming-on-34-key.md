You can excuse my drawing skills, I used to be good at drawing. Okay, let's not
get distracted by my original propaganda. 

# "keyboard under 3K INR"

Okay, so before even the journey begins I don't bother with keyboard much. I think of keyboard just as a tool used as input device
(I still do btw) to pass bytecode so that my computer can convert that bytecode to the actuall human readable code.
But when I used my friends keyboard(mechanical keyboard), typing on that feels so elegant. It was like for the first time
I felt that I need to change my keyboard for good. So, I begin my search operation.

## The budget 

I set my budget to 3k, yeah I know it's not much for some people but whatever.
Initially I want keyboard that should be customizable
